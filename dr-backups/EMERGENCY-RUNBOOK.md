## âš¡ IMMEDIATE RESPONSE PROCEDURES

### STEP 1: ASSESS THE SITUATION (5 minutes)

**Determine the type of emergency:**

- [ ] **Data Loss/Corruption**: Files or databases are missing or corrupted
- [ ] **Complete System Failure**: All services are down
- [ ] **Partial Service Outage**: Some services are unavailable
- [ ] **Security Incident**: System compromise suspected
- [ ] **Hardware Failure**: Server or storage hardware issues
- [ ] **Network/Connectivity Issues**: Cannot access systems

**Quick Assessment Checklist:**
```bash
# Check system status
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml ps

# Check database connectivity
pg_isready -h localhost -p 5432 -U odoo_master

# Check disk space
df -h

# Check recent logs
tail -100 /var/log/syslog
```

### STEP 2: IMMEDIATE CONTAINMENT (10 minutes)

**For Security Incidents:**
1. Disconnect affected systems from network
2. Preserve current state for forensics
3. Contact security team immediately

**For Other Incidents:**
1. Stop affected services gracefully
2. Create emergency backup of current state
3. Document the incident

**Emergency Documentation:**
```bash
# Create incident log
echo "$(date): INCIDENT STARTED - [DESCRIPTION]" >> dr-backups/logs/emergency-$(date +%Y%m%d).log

# Capture system state
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml ps > incident-system-state.log
df -h > incident-disk-usage.log
```

## ðŸ”¥ RECOVERY PROCEDURES

### SCENARIO A: COMPLETE SYSTEM FAILURE

**Estimated Recovery Time: 1-2 hours**

#### Phase 1: Preparation (15 minutes)

1. **Verify Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   # Check hardware/VM status
   # Verify network connectivity
   # Confirm disk availability
   ```

2. **Prepare Recovery Environment**
   ```bash
   cd "K:\Odoo Multi-Tenant System\dr-backups"
   
   # Check encryption key
   ls -la config/encryption.key
   
   # Verify latest backup
   ./scripts/validate-backup.sh
   ```

3. **Notify Stakeholders**
   - Send initial incident notification
   - Provide estimated recovery time
   - Establish communication channel

#### Phase 2: System Recovery (45-60 minutes)

1. **Download Latest Backup from Cloud**
   ```bash
   # List available backups
   aws s3 ls s3://company-dr-backups/backups/ | tail -10
   
   # Full recovery from cloud
   ./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh -c --force
   ```

2. **Alternative: Local Backup Recovery**
   ```bash
   # If cloud is unavailable, use latest local backup
   ./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh --force
   ```

3. **Monitor Recovery Progress**
   ```bash
   # Follow recovery logs
   tail -f logs/recovery-*.log
   ```

#### Phase 3: Verification (15-30 minutes)

   ```bash
   # Run health verification
   ./scripts/dr-monitor.sh
   
   # Check all services
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml ps
   
   # Test database connectivity
   pg_isready -h localhost -p 5432 -U odoo_master
   ```

2. **Application Testing**
   - [ ] Web interface accessible
   - [ ] User authentication working
   - [ ] Database queries responding
   - [ ] File uploads/downloads working
   - [ ] Email notifications working

3. **Performance Verification**
   ```bash
   # Check system load
   top

   iostat -x 1 5
   
   # Check memory usage
   free -h
   ```

### SCENARIO B: DATA CORRUPTION/LOSS

**Estimated Recovery Time: 30-90 minutes**

#### Phase 1: Damage Assessment (10 minutes)

1. **Identify Affected Components**
   ```bash

   # Check specific tenant database
   psql -h localhost -U odoo_master -d kdoo_tenant1 -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM res_users;"
   ```

2. **Assess Backup Requirements**
   ```bash
   # Find last known good backup
   ./scripts/validate-backup.sh
   
   # Check backup age
   ls -la dr-backups/sessions/
   ```

#### Phase 2: Targeted Recovery (20-60 minutes)

1. **Database-Only Recovery**
   ```bash
   # Stop services first
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down
   
   # Recover databases only
   ./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh -m database-only --force
   
   # Start services
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

2. **File Storage Recovery (if needed)**
   ```bash
   # Files-only recovery
   ./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh -m files-only --force
   ```

#### Phase 3: Data Verification (10-20 minutes)

1. **Verify Data Integrity**
   ```bash
   # Check recent transactions
   psql -h localhost -U odoo_master -d kdoo_tenant1 -c "SELECT * FROM res_users ORDER BY create_date DESC LIMIT 10;"
   
   # Verify file attachments
   ls -la odoo_filestore/
   ```

2. **User Acceptance Testing**
   - [ ] Login as test user
   - [ ] Create test record
   - [ ] Upload test file
   - [ ] Generate test report

### SCENARIO C: PARTIAL SERVICE OUTAGE

**Estimated Recovery Time: 15-45 minutes**

   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml ps
   
   # Check individual containers
   docker logs odoo_master
   docker logs postgres
   docker logs nginx
   ```

2. **Check Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Database connectivity
   pg_isready -h localhost -p 5432 -U odoo_master
   
   # Redis connectivity  
   redis-cli ping
   
   # Network connectivity
   curl -I http://localhost:8069
   ```

#### Phase 2: Service Recovery (10-30 minutes)

1. **Restart Failed Services**
   ```bash
   # Restart specific service
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml restart [service_name]

   ```

### SCENARIO D: SECURITY INCIDENT

**Estimated Recovery Time: 2-4 hours**

#### Phase 1: Immediate Response (15 minutes)

1. **Isolate Systems**
   ```bash
   # Stop all services immediately
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down
   
   # Disconnect from network (if possible)
   # Document current state before changes
   ```

2. **Preserve Evidence**
   ```bash
   # Create forensic backup
   mkdir -p incident-$(date +%Y%m%d)/
   cp -r logs/ incident-$(date +%Y%m%d)/logs/
