## Common Usage Patterns

### For khudroo.com Production Deployment:
```bash
# RECOMMENDED: Most reliable
./ssl-auto-setup.sh khudroo.com admin@khudroo.com

# Alternative: Main domain only (if www DNS issues)
./get-ssl-main.sh khudroo.com admin@khudroo.com
```

### For NAT/Router Environments:
```bash
# Skip local connectivity tests
./ssl-auto-setup.sh --skip-tests khudroo.com admin@khudroo.com
```

### For Debugging Issues:
```bash
# Enable comprehensive debug logging
./ssl-auto-setup.sh --debug khudroo.com admin@khudroo.com
```

### For Certificate Renewal:
```bash
# Force renewal even if certificate exists
./ssl-auto-setup.sh --force khudroo.com admin@khudroo.com
```

## Success Indicators

Regardless of which script you choose, look for:

✅ **"SSL setup completed successfully!"** message  
✅ **Certificate files created** in `ssl/certbot/conf/live/`  
✅ **Nginx configuration** updated in `nginx/conf.d/`  
✅ **Auto-renewal cron job** added  
✅ **HTTPS working** when accessing your domain  

## If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Check logs**: Each script creates detailed logs
2. **Use debug mode**: `./ssl-auto-setup.sh --debug`
3. **Verify prerequisites**: DNS, ports 80/443 open, Docker running
4. **Try main domain only**: `./get-ssl-main.sh`
5. **Check common issues**: Rate limits, DNS propagation, firewall

## Final Recommendation

**For most users, especially first-time SSL setup, use `ssl-auto-setup.sh`**. It's the most comprehensive, reliable, and user-friendly solution with the best error handling and troubleshooting capabilities.
